# Hello My name is kjfreidhof and i am the author of this script 

# About this script 

I wanted to create a script that was easy to get discord easy and simple to setup on 
debian and i think i accomplished that with this script 


# Requirements 

all you really need is git but i am going to package this as a binary release as well on 
github you wont maybe need it in the future but for now you need git 

```
sudo apt install git 
```

# How to run the scripts

First do 

```
chmod +x debian-discord.sh
```

```
chmod +x unpack.sh 
```
secondly and lastly run the scripts 

```
./debian-discord.sh
```

```
./unpack.sh 
```

Also do not need root to run any of these scripts because they elevate 
you to root for you 

so you do not need to be root 

Also make sure to follow the instructions in the script i explain everything on 
what to do in the script 

# Then your done thanks for installing :)
